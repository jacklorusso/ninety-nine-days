A few people have asked for camping recommendations so I’m blogging a little closer to home this time and sharing some of my favourite camping spots in New South Wales. Whilst I’m desperate to get overseas and explore somewhere new, these amazing little spots in NSW are pretty incredible in their own right and are much (!!) more affordable than traveling internationally.
