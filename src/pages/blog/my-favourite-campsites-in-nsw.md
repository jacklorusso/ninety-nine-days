A few people have asked for camping recommendations so I’m blogging a little closer to home this time and sharing some of my favourite camping spots in New South Wales. Whilst I’m desperate to get overseas and explore somewhere new, these amazing little spots in NSW are pretty incredible in their own right and are much (!!) more affordable than traveling internationally.

**Bellingen (Gumbaynggirr Country)**

My number one spot in NSW is Bellingen. I love it so much that it’s probably one of my favourite spots in the entire world; I’m pretty set on one day doing some locum work up here! Bellingen is 515km North of Sydney and the drive is around five and a half hours.

My friend Gaia and I visited in January 2021 and camped at the free campground in Thora: [Roses Park Rest Area](http://www.camparoundaustralia.com.au/campsites/roses-park-rest-area/). It doesn’t require bookings, so is great for a last minute trip. Set amongst the mountains and pine trees, it’s only a minute walk down to the river - perfect since the campground is very basic and doesn't have showers (its only amenities are drop toilets). The service station next door doubles as a general store and also serves delicious toasties (vegan options and all) and also sells alcohol and basic supplies.

The Bellingen & Dorrigo area feels magical; waterfalls around every turn with so many spots to go for a swim. The highlight for me was ‘The Promised Lands’ (also known as Never Never Creek).

I’m heading back there after Christmas and will do a dedicated post on Bellingen sharing my favourite cafes, shops and spots in the new year.



**Barrington Tops**

Barrington Tops is a beautiful national park to camp in. We stayed just outside it at the [Riverwood Downs campsite](https://www.riverwooddowns.com.au/) with a big bunch of friends in January 2021. 240km North of Sydney, it’s situated right on the Karuah River.

If you visit, try and head as far up the river as you can to find a nice secluded spot to swim in. We took lilos and floated our way down the river rapids.

Riverwood Downs has great amenities: there are hot showers, powered sites and a store to buy ice-cream from. It has a restaurant too, as well as a bunch of cabins that you can stay in if you want something more luxe. Having said that, it’s pretty busy and the campsite gets packed so it doesn’t have that same feel of being out in nature as some of the other campsites have. This campsite costs $16 per person per night and tends to book up pretty fast. 



**The Basin (Gadigal Country)**

Finally, if you’re really pressed on time, a night away at [The Basin](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/camping-and-accommodation/campgrounds/the-basin-campground) does the trick and makes you feel as though you’ve escaped the city. The Basin is a quick 20-minute [ferry ride](https://www.fantasea.com.au/palm-beach-ferries/timetable/) from Palm Beach Jetty and has all of the makings of a good campsite. On your way home, I'd recommend a stop at the [Boat House](https://www.theboathousepb.com.au/) for a feed.
