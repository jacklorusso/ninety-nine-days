Make sure to visit the Dolomites if you can! The entire area is absolutely beautiful and I was so excited the entire time by all the nature I was seeing – forests of pine trees filling the air (and car) with a strong pine smell, rugged mountains, amazing lakes and farmland home to beautiful brown cows. It didn’t take long for us to fall totally in love with the Dolomites.Where to go?By far, the most amazing site is Pragsee Wildersee/Lake Braies. I’d seen photos online, but this lake still managed to totally blow me away and is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I was excited to get right into it and I had high hopes for Pragsee Wildersee so we decided to Lake MisurinaHow to exploreWe picked up a car in Verona and returned it to the same location. We just booked the cheapest car on Expedia which ended up being through the company Allemo. The car we hired ended up being an Audi A1! All up, the car cost us 105 euros (it would have been 75 euros but we had to pay an extra 30 euros because we’re under 25). All in all, hiring a car was definitely the easiest way to get around. I’m sure that some people manage to hop around the area on buses but I didn’t really investigate it.
