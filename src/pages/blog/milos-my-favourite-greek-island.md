It’s no secret that the Greek Islands are incredible, but Milos was something else. The landscapes were utterly unique and seriously breathtaking. I've only been to Santorini, Ios, Kos and Milos, but Milos is my favourite by far.

## Where we stayed

Based on my sister’s recommendation we stayed in Adamantas, the port town of Milos. I’d recommend staying in this area as it’s central to the various beaches you’ll want to explore, has lots of shops and restaurants, but still doesn’t feel overly crowded. In reality though, Milos is quite a small island so as long as you hire a mope/quad, you'll be totally fine if you stay in Plaka, Polonia, or any other town. If you're going to rely on getting around by bus though, I'd definitely recommend staying in Admantas as this is where all the buses leave from.

We decided to splurge a little bit in Milos and book a relatively nice guesthouse. Prices vary wildly depending on which month you visit, but we stayed at [Soulis Studios](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/soulis-adamas.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-gr-soulisNadamas-unspec-lk-com-L%3Aen-O%3AosSx-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=a3a8062454383b5c3c6d9609e89a432c;dist=0&keep_landing=1&sb_price_type=total&type=total&) and paid 226 euros for 3 nights (~$55AUD per person per night). We were really happy with where we stayed - it had a beautiful balcony looking over the ocean and was in a good location.

## Where we ate

On our first day in Milos we stumbled across [Artermis Bakery](https://www.google.lk/maps/place/Artemis+Bakery/@36.7254489,24.4465886,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x26915aff33a9fdf6?ved=2ahUKEwi_wqLEobreAhUJr48KHWPgA0kQ_BIwDnoECAYQCA) down by the port. They sold lots of baked goods, but the focaccias caught our eye, and much to our delight they happened to be vegan. Every day we stocked up on a mix of olive, and tomato & capsicum focaccias for breakfast and lunch. They were ridiculously good and despite the fact that we pretty much rolled off Milos as one big pile of bread, eating the focaccias for breakfast and lunch everyday was a great way of keeping costs down (each focaccia was huge and only cost 2 euros). It also meant we were able to pack a vegan lunch to eat while we were at the beach.

On our first night, we wandered down to the seaside to check out a cute little restaurant, lit up by fairy lights, that we’d driven past earlier that day. Mikros Apoplous, Apodo and Trapatseles are all next to each other and offer a similar menu. We chose to eat at Apodo because their vegan options looked the best. We happily watched the sunset while eating beautiful stuffed tomatoes and capsicums with Greek oven baked potatoes. We had such a lovely time that we came back every single night. It was great value too – a starter and two mains always came in at less than 20 euros.

## What we did

You want to allow at least 4 days on Milos so that you have plenty of time to explore all of the ridiculous landscapes Milos has on offer. We could have happily spent a week or two on Milos and it would have been nice to revisit some of the beaches we went to.

Sarakiniko: the one that’s really the moon. Sarakiniko is probably the most iconic ‘beach’ on Milos.

I loved Sarakiniko so much that I insisted we visit it three times.

The major drawback of Sarakiniko was the amount of plastic rubbish there was in the water. Right in the area where everyone was swimming, there was a mini island of plastic that had formed.

## How we got around

On our first day we just got the public bus from Admantas Port to Sarkiniko and back. It was only a 10 minute drive and the buses run every two hours and cost ~2 euros.

For the rest of our time on Milos, we hired a moped and rode around from beach to beach - it was so much fun!!! It's worth noting that we could only hire one because I had an international driver's license and we met some people who had to catch buses/taxis all over because they hadn't been able to hire a moped or quad. If you want to know more about international driver's licenses, I wrote about them here. 

## How we got to & from Milos

Milos is part of the Cyclades group and is well connected by both air and sea. Since it was the first island we visited, we decided to fly there from Athens (otherwise the ferry takes around 7 hours). We flew with Sky Express and the flight was only 20 minutes long (on a tiny plane that I wasn't too stoked about). We paid $130 per person for the flight.

After Milos we headed to Ios by ferry which took 3 hours and 15 minutes. I found the ferries in Greece to be frustratingly expensive since it was high season - we paid 50 euros each (~$77AUD) for this ferry.

Milos is well connected by ferry to all of the Cyclades islands so you shouldn't have any trouble hopping from island to island.
