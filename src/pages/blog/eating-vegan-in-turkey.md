Eating vegan in Turkey was a dream – easy, cheap and super tasty. We were able to eat a good variety of food, got in lots of veggies (something we struggled with in other countries) and it was really easy to 'veganise' lots of the traditional Turkish dishes.

## Our go-to meals

Turkish delight - I have been obsessed with Turkish delight since I was little. I assumed that Turkish Delight would contain gelatine, and had reconciled myself to the fact that I wouldn’t be able to eat any. One day in Fethiye, I thought that I may’s well check the ingredients, just to be sure. I was ridiculously excited to discover that Turkish Delight is in fact vegan (at least at all the places we saw it) because they make it from corn starch rather than gelatine. In Fethiye they sold fresh logs of rose and pomegranate Turkish Delight covered in pistachios, and we pretty much spent the next two weeks absolutely gorging ourselves.

Gozleme - gozleme was another food that we assumed wouldn’t be vegan. We discovered though, that the ‘bread’ part of the gozleme is more a dough rather than batter, and is normally just made with flour and water. Inside, we would just opt for the vegan fillings: spinach, potato and tomato are all popular options. This was such a delicious meal, especially when it was served with a wedge of lemon and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. It's worth clarifying though that you don't want any cheese, just to be sure.

Pide - essentially a Turkish twist on pizza, pide is normally served with minced meat and cheese. Most menus had a vegetarian pide as an option so we ordered that and asked for no cheese. This really weirded out the waiters, but it tasted good and was filling. Again, even better when served with a wedge of lemon and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.

## Our favourite meals

Sultan Cave Suites served up an incredible breakfast spread. A buffet breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was so so good. 

The meals that we ate at [Butterfly Valley](https://www.ninetyninedays.com.au/blog/butterfly-valley/) were amazing.

Kabak Valley also had really nice food.

## How much we spent

Overall, food was inexpensive and we were able to eat well for very little money. A lot of the places we stayed at had breakfast included, and we spent \~$10AUD per person on lunch and dinner. On average, pide and gozleme were around 15-20TRY (\~$3-4AUD) and turkish delight was 15TRY (~$3AUD) for a big log.
