Claude Monet lived in Giverny, a small village in the Normandy region of France and 75km from Paris, for most of his life. The gardens here formed the main inspiration for most of Monet’s paintings. I’ve always loved Monet’s artwork and been a big fan of the Impressionist Period in general, so visiting Giverny has been something I’ve wanted to do since I can remember. 



The garden is the best I’ve ever seen. The huge flower beds give the impression of being wonderfully wild yet perfectly manicured and it had me dreaming of one day owning a property big enough to have a huge flower garden. There were so many different types of flowers, and the range of colours was amazing. All the while there were bees buzzing busily around, butterflies flying from flower to flower…it was truly beautiful. 



We visited Monet’s Gardens in late June, and although it was pretty warm, we couldn’t have asked for better weather. Wandering around the gardens was magical and it was also really cool to check out the charming little town of Giverny – I’d definitely recommend a day trip (or even half day trip if you’re short on time) to Giverny.



**How to get there?**

You can easily explore Monet’s Gardens as a day trip from Paris. Giverny itself doesn’t have a train station, so it’s best to catch a train to Vernon. We caught a train from Paris St Lazare to Vernon. We’d actually been super organised (shock) and had booked our train tickets roughly a month in advance for 18 euros each return, but when we arrived at the train station, our train had been cancelled and we had to pay an extra 10 euros each to change our tickets to be valid for the next train. This also meant that we ended up arriving in Vernon roughly 3 hours later than we should have, so we were frustrated to say the least. The express train is meant to take only 47 minutes but we had to change trains and it ended up taking us close to 2 hours.From Vernon we’d planned on taking a shuttle bus to Giverny (10 euros return), but when we arrived there was also a little tourist choo-choo train that was on offer and was only 8 euros return so we figured we’d may’s well go with this cheaper and cuter (yet terribly cliché) tourist option. Otherwise it’s an hour walk into Giverny, although in the hot summer I think it’d definitely be worth paying for a transfer so you have more time to spend in Giverny or back in Paris!



**Tickets**

We bought our tickets in advance and I’m so glad we did! There was a huge line to get in and buy tickets, but if you’ve pre-bought them you can go through the group entrance (which had absolutely no queue). You can buy your tickets here (http://giverny.org/gardens/fcm/ticket/?) and then just make sure you save the PDF to your device. Entrance is 6.50 euros for students and 9.50 euros for adults (although they didn’t actually ask for my student card as proof). 



**What to do**

You actually aren’t allowed to eat inside the gardens so if you do bring a picnic be prepared to eat it
