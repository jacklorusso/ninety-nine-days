My sister Kate and I spent a week road-tripping Portugal. We flew into Porto and hopped straight into a hire car and headed down the coast stopping in at Nazaré and Óbidos before arriving in Lisbon. We spent a few days in Lisbon (and ate all the pastel de natas!) and did a day trip out to Sintra too. We finished up our trip by lazing on the beach and getting sunburnt in Lagos before driving all the way back to Porto.

These are the film photos that Kate and I took on her camera.
