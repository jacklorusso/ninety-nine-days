At the end of 2018, Jack and I, along with Emma, one of my best friends from uni, spent a few weeks in Nepal trekking (part of) the Annapurna Circuit. 

I'm going to write a post specifically about our time on the circuit, but wanted to share Emma's disposable film photos. They bring back the best memories!

This one is from up at Poon Hill - it was completely foggy when we went up and the mountains were totally covered.

Playing cards over a dahl baht was our fave thing to do at lunchtime.

Back in Pokhara. At our favourite restaurant (OR2K) and the Peace Pagoda.
