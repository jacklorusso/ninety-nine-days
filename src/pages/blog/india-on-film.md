At the end of 2017, my sister Kate and I spent two weeks in Northern India. It was a total last minute trip – we only booked two weeks before we left – but I was desperate to get away after my last semester of uni and the allure of cheap return flights to Jaipur (with Scoot) was too much to resist. 

We visited Jaipur, Agra, Udaipur, Chittorgarh and Pushkar. I have specific guides on each of these places, but Kate’s film (@kaatejackson on insta) was too beautiful not to share.
