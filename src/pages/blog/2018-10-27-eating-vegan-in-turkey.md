Eating vegan in Turkey was a dream – easy, cheap and super tasty. We were able to eat a good variety of food, got in lots of veggies (something we struggled with in other countries) and it was really easy to veganise lots of the traditional Turkish dishes. These are the foods that we spent most of our time eating.1)	Turkish delight. I have been obsessed with Turkish delight since I was young. I assumed that Turkish Delight would contain gelatine, and had reconciled myself to the fact that I wouldn’t be able to eat it. One day in Fethiye, I thought that I may’s well check the ingredient, just to be sure. I was ridiculously excited to discover that ‘regular’ Turkish Delight is in fact vegan (at least at all the places we saw it). In Fethiye they sold fresh logs of rose and pomegranate Turkish Delight covered in pistachios, and we pretty much spent the next two weeks absolutely gorging ourselves.2)	Gozleme. Gozleme was another food that we assumed wouldn’t be vegan, and wouldn’t be easy to veganise. We discovered though, that the ‘bread’ part of the gozleme is more a dough rather than batter, and is normally just made with flour and water. Inside, we would just opt for the vegan option. Spinach, potato and tomato are all popular fillings. This was such a delicious meal, and to make it even better, ask for a wedge of lemon and sprinkle over some salt and pepper. It’s worth clarifying that you don’t want any cheese though!3)	Pide. Essentially a Turkish twist on a pizza, pide is normally served with minced meat and 4)	Veggie Clay Pot.We ate well across the entire country, but these are some of the restaurants or cafés that deserve a special mention.
