Jack and I, along with Emma, one of my best friends from uni, spent the best part of December in India. It was Emma's first time in India so it was so much fun to see India through someone else's eyes for the first time and to show her around some of our favourite places.

The three of us visited Agra, Rishikesh, Jodhpur and Udaipur. I have specific guides on each of these places, but wanted to share Emma's disposable film shots too (she's @emmakench on insta).
