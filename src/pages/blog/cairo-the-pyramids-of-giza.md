We ventured into the Middle East because I was so charmed by Jordan, but once I realised that Cairo was less than 1000km from Amman, I couldn’t let go of the idea of exploring the pyramids. Given that this was an add on to our planned trip to Jordan, we didn’t have nearly as long as I otherwise would have wante - Egypt has so much more to offer than the pyramids! We settled for 4 days in Cairo and Giza, which ended up being a really lovely amount of time there, but definitely left us wanting to see more of Egypt; although I was a little intimidated by Egypt initially, I felt really comfortable traveling there and would love to go back and see more of the country. Top of my list is to go diving or snorkelling in Dahab, and to explore ancient wonders in Luxor, Abu Simbel and Aswan.

\[A sentence or two describing Cairo and the pyramids].
Cairo is a huge sprawling city and seems so rundown. All the buildings are brown, the smog is really noticeable, and yet on our drive out to Giza we spotted several pockets of lush green farmland.

## Where to stay

We moved around when we were in Egypt; we spent a couple of nights in a hostel in Cairo, and then treated ourselves to two nights at the Marriot in Giza.

There are so many budget options in Cairo, but upon recommendation we stayed at Meramees Hostel in central Cairo, only 10 minutes’ walk from the Egyptian museum and Tahrir Square. This hostel has beautiful high ceilings, a cosy common room with friendly staff, and a cute little balcony looking out over Cairo. The biggest downside is that you have to climb six flights of stairs to get up there – not the end of the world, but could be a deal breaker if you’re traveling with a big suitcase or lots of luggage.

If you’re looking for something a little more bougie, I can’t recommend Giza’s Marriot Mena House enough. The grounds are incredible: well-manicured lawns, beautiful gardens and a fancy swimming pool.

If you decide to stay there, request room 438 – it’s on the top floor and at the perfect angle to have an incredible view of the pyramids.

We scored a last minute deal on Booking.com

The security here was really stringent: a sniffer dog inspected the taxi and our luggage when we arrived, and to enter into the reception and the hotel room building, our baggage had to be scanned and we had to go through a metal detector.

## What to do

You can’t really go to Egypt and not see the pyramids. I’d recommend at least 3 hours to explore the pyramids, although we actually visited them over two days and spent a total of around 8 hours there.

The Egyptian Museum is a pretty magical place and it’s incredible just how many ancient wonders there are housed within the one building. If you’re an ancient history buff, you could easily spend hours inside, and even if you’re not, it’s still an interesting place to spend a couple of hours. The museum isn’t air-conditioned though, so if you visit in Summer, prepare to overheat. I would also suggest getting a guide as barely any of the artefacts had information labels.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle of Cairo, Al Azhar Park, right in the city centre, is the perfect respite, and a really lovely place to spend a few hours relaxing. The park is filled with families picnicking, children playing in water fountains and young couples. It truly showcases Egypt as a family oriented, friendly country.

Some of the things that I would have liked to have visited but didn’t get to are

## The Food

Egyptian food is gooood! Just like other areas in the Middle East, falafels. Accompanied by pickles, hummus etc., are the go to option if you’re veg. While we were staying at the Marriot, we did also eat some really good Indian as well as a tasty risotto.

When you’re in central Cairo, you can’t go past Kazaz! It’s a fast food restaurant but serves authentic Egyptian food and is seriously popular with the locals. Falafel pitas were 2.25 EGP which is literally less than 20c!!! This meant that we could both eat a meal for less than $1. An added bonus was that it’s only 100m down the road from Meramees, and for a small fee you can even get it delivered.

## How to get to Egypt

I was surprised to find out that it’s relatively inexpensive to fly into Cairo from Europe: you should be able to get return flights from Athens, Rome or Paris for around $350 AUD (Aegean Airlines is your best bet).

Having said that, we travelled overland in and out of Egypt since we were already in the Middle East. Into Egypt, we travelled from Aqaba, Jordan to Cairo which took a total of 17 hours. Out of Egypt, we travelled from Cairo to Jerusalem, Israel which took a ridiculous and exhausting 25 hours. If you want to read more, I’ve written a dedicated blog post about the logistics of traveling overland through Jordan, Israel and Egypt.
