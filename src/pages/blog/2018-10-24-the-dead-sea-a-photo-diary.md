Floating in the Dead Sea had been on my bucket list for years: the idea of a sea so salty that you floated seemed pretty surreal. We visited the Dead Sea on the Jordanian side, on a day trip from Amman.

The water was 36 degrees and the outside temperature was 34 degrees. Don’t forget to bring sunscreen, and make sure not to get any water in your eyes, ears or mouth. It stings!

We couldn’t resist lathering ourselves in mud which is rich in calcium, magnesium, sodium and calcium and believed to be healing. It cost 3JD each (~$6AUD).
